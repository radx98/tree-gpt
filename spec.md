# TreeGPT Spec

## Initial Layout

When the app is loaded the user sees an input field in the middle of the page (similar to Google Search or ChatGPT). The field has an 'Ask anything' placeholder and a Send button in the right end of it. When the user enters their prompt and sends it with the Send button or by pressing Enter, the app switches to the main layout.
