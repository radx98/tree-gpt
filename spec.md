## 1. Core concept

The app is a ChatGPT-like interface where conversations are **non-linear** and represented as a **tree of nodes**, each node being a **single column** in the UI.

* **Vertical axis**: time within a single column (a linear chat between user and LLM).
* **Horizontal axis**: branching depth in the conversation tree.

Each **column = one node** in the JSON tree:

* The **root column** is the entry point of the session.
* From any message, the user can select text and spawn a **child column** to the right.
* Under the hood, the app stores the **full tree** (all nodes and branches).
* In the UI, the user **explores one branch at a time**: the visible columns are the nodes along the active path from the root to the currently focused node.
* The user can jump back into already explored branches by clicking highlights that represent previously created branches.

Every column/node:

* Holds a linear conversation (user and LLM messages).
* Has an AI-generated header (the root column header becomes the session name).
* Knows which parent selection it came from.
* Can itself spawn further branches.

---

## 2. Terminology

* **Session**
  A complete non-linear conversation tree, starting from a single root column and containing all derived branches. Stored as a JSON in the browser local storage.

* **Node / Column**
  A single linear chat thread and a single node in the session tree.

  * Exactly one node per column.
  * Each node has:

    * An AI-generated header.
    * A linear list of messages.
    * A reference to its **parent node** (the root doesn't have one).
    * A reference to the **text selection** that created it.
    * A depth (0 for root, 1 for its children, etc.).

* **Message**
  One user prompt or one LLM response inside a node.

* **Linear input field**
  The main input at the bottom of a column, used to continue that node’s chat linearly.

* **Context input field**
  A temporary mini input that appears **above a text selection** inside a message. Sending from it creates a **new child node / column** to the right.

* **Highlight**
  A persistent visual mark on a text selection that has at least one branch associated with it. Highlights indicate places where branches exist and let the user navigate to those branches. The highlight who's child node is open on the right appears brighter than the other highlights in the same column.

* **Active branch**
  The ordered list of node ids from the root node to the current node. Columns on screen always correspond to the active branch only. It always starts with the root/0 but not necessarily ends with the last node in the branch. The following nodes if there are any can be opened by clicking/tapping the highlights.

---

## 3. Layout & appearance

### 3.1 Global layout

* Overall design is **minimalistic**, with no decorative elements.
* Typeface: **Helvetica** for all text (other standard sans-serif if no Helvetica).
* Background: white.
* **Thin gray lines** separate main UI areas (e.g., top bar from content, columns from each other, vertical column bars shown when a column is out of the viewport).

At the very top:

* A **viewport-wide bar** spans the full width.
* On the **left** inside this bar:

  * A **Lucide “square-menu” icon button**.
  * Immediately to the right of it: the **app name** (plain text).
* The top bar has a thin gray line at its bottom edge to separate it from the main content.

Below the top bar:

* The main content area is a horizontally scrollable row of columns (the active branch).
* Each column extends from below the top bar to the bottom of the viewport and can be scrolled vertically separately from the others.

### 3.2 Root column initial state

The **root column**:

* Sits on the **left** side of the main area.
* Has maximum width of approximately `max-w-3xl`.
* Uses the full available height between top bar and viewport bottom.

Initial state of a new session, before any messages:

* The column contains:

  * A **centered placeholder block** in the main area with:

    * Text: `"A new rabbithole entrance is right here"`.
    * A **Lucide “arrow-down” icon** below the text.
  * A **floating “Ask anything” linear input** at the bottom:

    * Sticks to the bottom of the column (above any system scroll indicators).
    * Minimal padding and minimal corner rounding.
    * Includes an integrated **Send button** on the right side.
    * Submit is triggered by:

      * Clicking the Send button, or
      * Pressing Enter (with appropriate handling for multiline if implemented).

As soon as the first conversation turn starts (user sends the first message), the placeholder disappears permanently for that session.

### 3.3 Column structure

Each visible column (node) shows:

* **Header area** at the top of the column content:

  * The AI-generated h3 header (short title describing the node).
  * Stays fixed at the top of that column’s scrollable area.
* **Messages area** below the header:

  * A vertically scrolling stack of messages.
  * The scroll is **per column** and independent across columns.
* **Linear input area** at the bottom of the column:

  * Floats at the bottom of that column’s scrollable viewport.
  * For the **current/focused column**, the linear input is active and visible.
  * For other visible columns, the linear input is hidden completely.
  * Every column has some additional padding at the bottom to prevent the linear input field from overlapping with the column content.

Columns are separated from each other visually by a thin vertical gray line, same as those separation other elements.

### 3.4 Message styling

Within any column:

* **User messages**:

  * Right-aligned.
  * Max width ~**80%** of the column width.
  * Light gray background.
  * Minimal border radius.
  * User can use markdown for formatting.

* **LLM messages**:

  * Left-aligned.
  * Occupy **the full column width**; they do not sit inside a visible container.
  * No distinct background container; just text with standard spacing and typographic hierarchy.
  * Support **markdown rendering** (headings, lists, code, emphasis) to improve readability. The LLM is instructed to use markdown if it serves the purpose.

Messages appear in strict chronological order:

* User → LLM → user → LLM → …

### 3.5 Input fields

**Linear input field** (per column):

* Located at the bottom of the active column.
* Styling:

  * Floats at the bottom.
  * A white text input area inside.
  * Minimal padding from the column edges and bottom.
  * Minimal rounding.
  * Integrated Send button on the right.
* Behavior:

  * In the **current column**, the input is visible:

    * Focusable, editable, and can submit data.
  * In **other visible columns** the input is hidden.
  * On send:

    * The text is treated as a new prompt for this node.
    * The app sends a request to the LLM (see §10).
    * The new user message appears in the message list, followed by the LLM response when received.

**Context input field**:

* Appears when the user selects non-empty text within any message (user or LLM).
* Styling:

  * A mini version of the linear input:

    * Smaller width.
    * Minimal rounding.
    * Appears directly **above** the selected text, anchored visually to it.
* Behavior:

  * On send:

    * The context input disappears.
    * A new **child column** is created to the **right** of the column where the selection was made. It contains the user message that's jsut been sent.
    * The app sends a request to the LLM (see §10) and then adds a generated header and a response to the user message to that new column.
    * The selected text becomes a **highlight** (see §5.3).

---

## 4. Column & navigation behavior

### 4.1 Current / focused column

At any moment, exactly **one column is “current”**.

* The current column:

  * Has an active linear input.
  * Looks normal, while in other columns all the elements are 15% paler.

The user can change focus by clicking or tapping anywhere inside a column (header, message area, or input). Any interaction with a column makes it the current/focused.

Horizontal scroll also changes focus. The algorythm making that possible works the following way:

As the user scrolls horizontally, compute how far they are between the left and right ends (from 0% to 100%). Place an invisible **focus point** inside the viewport at the same percentage between its left and right edges. The **focused column** is always the one that covers this focus point.

The user can focus on a column without scrolling, just by interacting with it as described above. But as soon as the content is horizontally scrolled for more than 5% of the viewport width, the scroll algorythm takes control back.

### 4.2 Vertical scrolling

* Every column has its own **independent vertical scroll**.
* Scrolling one column does not affect the scroll of others.
* The **linear input**cis fixed to the bottom of the column’s viewport, so it remains visible as the user scrolls messages.
* The content has additional padding at the bottom to account for the linear input field height.

### 4.3 Horizontal scrolling

* The row of columns for the active branch can be **wider than the viewport**.
* When there are more columns than fit horizontally:

  * The user can scroll horizontally:

    * With scrollbars on desktop.
    * With horizontal drag/swipe on touch devices.

### 4.4 Hidden column indicators (edge bars)

When a column is fully offscreen to the left or right:

* A **vertical bar** appears along that viewport edge representing that hidden column.
* The bar:

  * Spans from the bottom of the top bar to the bottom of the viewport.
  * Has the column’s header text written **vertically**, rotated 90° clockwise.
  * Use a thin gray border same as the other elements and white background.

If multiple columns are hidden on one side:

* Their vertical bars are **stacked** along that edge.
* Each bar corresponds to one hidden column (ordered consistently, e.g., nearest to the visible area first).

Interaction:

* Clicking or tapping a bar:

  * Scrolls horizontally so that the represented column comes back into view. It's left/right edge (depending on behind which side of the viewport it was hidden) is aligned with the closest to the center edge bar left after that. If there is no edge bars left, it aligns with the viewport edge.
  * Focuses the column the edge bar represented.

---

## 5. Branching interactions

### 5.1 Selecting text & context input

* The user can select any contiguous range inside a message in any visible column.
* Once a non-empty selection exists (and if it is not spanning text from more than one message), a **context input field** appears directly above the selection.

The user can:

* Type a prompt in the context input.
* Send the prompt (Enter or Send button).
* Cancel by clicking outside or clearing the selection.

### 5.2 Creating a new branch column

When the user sends a prompt via the **context input**:

1. The selection (text and offsets) is captured (and cancelled as if the user clicked out or pressed Esc) and highlighted.
2. A new **child node** is created in the session tree with:

   * Parent node id = the node where the selection was made.
   * Parent message id = the message containing the selection.
   * Selection text and character offsets.
3. A new **column** is created to the **right** of the parent column:

   * The new column becomes the **last column** in the active branch.
   * The active branch is updated to include this new node at the end.
4. The new column’s header is initially filled with gray slightly rounded placeholder block representing future header (until the LLM suggests one).
5. The LLM request is built with full branch context (see §10).
6. When the LLM responds:

   * The context prompt becomes the first user message in the new column.
   * The LLM reply becomes the first assistant message in that column.
   * The column’s header is set from the LLM-provided header.

### 5.3 Highlights and branch switching

Highlights represent selections that **already have branches**:

* When a context input is sent and a child node is successfully created:

  * The selected text in the parent message becomes a **persistent highlight**.
* Highlight states:

  * **Active highlight**:

    * The highlight whose child node lies on the **current active branch**, i.e. in the column on the right (for that selection).
    * Appears brighter or more saturated.
  * **Inactive highlight**:

    * Highlights whose child nodes are **not** on the current active branch, i.e. not displayed on the right.
    * Appear slightly **paler** but remain visible.

Interaction with highlights:

* Clicking an inactive highlight:

  * Switches the active branch to the branch that ends at that highlight’s child node (no further nodes/columns are displayed after it). If there was a column on the right from the one containing this highlight, it gets hidden. Instead of it the highlight's child node/column is shown.
  * Doesn't change the other columns.
  * The clicked highlight becomes active (bright).
* Clicking an active highlight (if multiple branches exist from the same selection or a few highlights intersect at the clicked character) shows a small chooser to pick one branch.

---

## 6. Session header & top bar

The top bar:

* Lucide **square-menu** icon button.
* App name label.

The **square-menu button**:

* Opens a **dropdown menu** listing all sessions:

  * Each item displays:

    * The session name (root node header).
    * Lucide **trash-2** button to delete the session.
  * The **current session** is clearly highlighted.
* Clicking a session in the dropdown:

  * Switches the activeSessionId in the data model.
  * Loads the tree for that session.
  * Reconstructs and renders the active branch for that session (typically from root to last focused node).

Session titles:

* Each session uses the root node’s header as its **session title**.
* The **root column header and the session title are always identical**:

  * When the LLM proposes a header for the root node, the session title is set to exactly that string.

---

## 7. Behavioral summary

1. User opens the app.
2. A **new session** is available or loaded; the root column appears on the left with:

   * Placeholder text and arrow-down icon.
   * “Ask anything” input at the bottom.
3. User types into the root’s linear input and sends:

   * Placeholder disappears.
   * The root column shows the user message and then the LLM reply.
   * The root header is generated by the LLM and becomes the session title.
4. User continues linearly in any visible column via its (active) linear input.
5. At any time, the user can select text in any message:

   * A context input appears above the selection.
   * Sending from it creates a child column to the right.
   * The selected text becomes a highlight.
6. The active branch is the sequence of columns from root to the last displayed column; only these columns are visible.
7. Previously created branches are represented by **pale highlights**:

   * Clicking them switches back to those branches and shows one column they lead to but none of the further columns.
8. Each column’s vertical scroll is independent; horizontal scroll is available for the whole branch.
9. Columns that move completely out of view are represented by vertical edge bars at the viewport edges with vertically displayed header text; clicking a bar scrolls that column back into view.

---

## 8. Data model and identifiers

All persistent state is represented as JSON that can be:

* Stored in browser storage.
* Sent to the LLM as context.
* Used to reconstruct UI purely from data.

### 8.1 Session

A session object contains:

* `"id"`: unique session id.
* `"title"`: session title (always equal to root node header).
* `"rootNodeId"`: id of the root node.
* `"nodes"`: map of node ids → node objects.
* `"createdAt"` / `"updatedAt"`: timestamps.

Example shape (conceptual):

{ "id": "session_123", "title": "Intro to matrix multiplication", "rootNodeId": "node_root", "nodes": { ... }, "createdAt": "ISO timestamp", "updatedAt": "ISO timestamp" }

### 8.2 Node / column

Each node represents exactly one column and contains:

* `"id"`: node id.
* `"depth"`: integer, 0 for root, 1 for its children, etc.
* `"header"`: AI-generated title string (or null before set).
* `"parent"`: either null (for root) or an object describing where this node branched from:

  * `"parentNodeId"`: id of the parent node.
  * `"parentMessageId"`: id of the message containing the selection.
  * `"selection"`:

    * `"text"`: the selected text.
    * `"startOffset"` / `"endOffset"`: character offsets within the parent message text.
* `"messages"`: array of message objects (see §8.3), in chronological order.
* Optional `"children"`: list of child node ids for convenience (can be derived but may be stored for fast traversal).

Conceptual example:

{
"id": "node_7",
"depth": 2,
"header": "Concrete example for clause X",
"parent": {
"parentNodeId": "node_3",
"parentMessageId": "msg_18",
"selection": {
"text": "the clause describing termination",
"startOffset": 120,
"endOffset": 180
}
},
"messages": [ ... ]
}

The root node has `"parent": null` and `"depth": 0`.

### 8.3 Message

Messages are stored in `node.messages` as plain JSON objects:

* `"id"`: unique within the session (e.g., "msg_5").
* `"role"`: `"user"` or `"assistant"`.
* `"text"`: message content.
* `"createdAt"`: timestamp.
* `"highlights"`: array of highlight link objects (see §8.4) for selections in this message that have branches.

Conceptual example:

{ "id": "msg_5", "role": "user", "text": "What happens if the matrix is singular?", "createdAt": "ISO timestamp", "highlights": [ ... ] }

Messages in each node are append-only: new messages are appended to the end in send order.

### 8.4 Highlights and branch links

Highlights do not exist as separate top-level entities; they are stored on the **message** level.

Each highlight entry in `message.highlights` includes:

* `"highlightId"`: unique id for the highlight.
* `"startOffset"` / `"endOffset"`: character offsets in `message.text`.
* `"text"`: the exact substring.
* `"childNodeId"`: id of the node that this highlight leads to (one child per highlight for the base spec).
* `"isActive"`: optional UI flag indicating whether this highlight’s child node lies on the **current active branch**.

Conceptual example:

{
"highlightId": "hl_9",
"startOffset": 120,
"endOffset": 180,
"text": "the clause describing termination",
"childNodeId": "node_7",
"isActive": true
}

This allows the UI to:

* Render the highlight with different tint depending on isActive.
* Navigate to the child node on click (switching the active branch).

### 8.5 Active branch and UI state

The **active branch** and lightweight UI state are stored separately from sessions:

* `"version"`: numeric schema version.
* `"activeSessionId"`: id of the current session.
* `"activeBranchNodeIds"`: ordered array of node ids forming the currently visible path from root to the current node.
* `"currentNodeId"`: id of the current/focused node (usually the last element of activeBranchNodeIds).

Optional UI state:

* `"lastFocusedNodeId"`: latest focused node in this session.
* Per-session last focused nodes if needed.

Top-level state example:

{
"version": 1,
"activeSessionId": "session_123",
"activeBranchNodeIds": ["node_root", "node_3", "node_7"],
"currentNodeId": "node_7",
"sessions": {
"session_123": { ... }
}
}

### 8.6 Persistent vs ephemeral state

**Persistent state** (stored in browser storage):

* Entire `sessions` map.
* `activeSessionId`.
* `activeBranchNodeIds`.
* `currentNodeId`.
* Node headers, messages, parent links, highlights, timestamps.

**Ephemeral state** (in memory only):

* Current text in any linear input.
* Current text in a context input field.
* Current raw text selection before a branch is created.
* Loading / error indicators.
* Scroll positions for columns.
* Hover states and other transient UI flags.

---

## 9. Local browser storage

All persistent state is stored under a **single key** in browser storage, for example `"branching_chat_state"`.

### 9.1 Initial load

On app startup:

1. The app attempts to read and parse the JSON snapshot from storage.
2. If nothing is stored:

   * Initialize with an empty state such as:
     { "version": 1, "activeSessionId": null, "sessions": {}, "activeBranchNodeIds": [], "currentNodeId": null }.
3. If parsing fails or structure is invalid:

   * Fallback to the same empty state.
   * Optionally keep the corrupted payload under a separate key for manual recovery.

### 9.2 Saving updates

Whenever a **meaningful change** happens, the in-memory state is updated and then serialized back into storage. Changes include:

* Creating a new session and its root node.
* Adding user or assistant messages to a node.
* Creating a new node via context branching.
* Updating node headers.
* Updating highlight active states.
* Changing activeSessionId, activeBranchNodeIds or currentNodeId.

To avoid excessive writes:

* Writes can be debounced:

  * After each state change, schedule a write a few hundred milliseconds later.
  * If more changes happen before the timer fires, they are coalesced into a single write.

The stored snapshot always contains a fully consistent representation of:

{ "version": 1, "activeSessionId": "...", "activeBranchNodeIds": [...], "currentNodeId": "...", "sessions": { ... } }

### 9.3 Session lifecycle

Creating a new session:

1. Generate a new session id.
2. Create a root node with:

   * depth = 0,
   * parent = null,
   * empty messages array,
   * null header initially.
3. Create a session object with:

   * rootNodeId = root node id.
   * title = null (until header is set).
4. Set activeSessionId to the new session id.
5. Set activeBranchNodeIds to `[rootNodeId]` and currentNodeId to rootNodeId.
6. Persist the state.

Deleting or closing sessions:

* Remove the session entry from `sessions`.
* If the deleted session was active:

  * Clear activeBranchNodeIds and currentNodeId or switch to another session.
* Persist the updated state.

### 9.4 Versioning

A top-level `"version"` field enables migrations:

* On load, the app checks the version.
* If it is older than the code’s current schema, apply data transformations.
* Save the transformed state back with the new version.

---

## 10. LLM payload and minimal storage

### 10.1 State used for LLM and storage

For each session:

* The **full tree** is stored as described in §8 (sessions, nodes, messages, highlights).
* Additionally, the **current branch** (visible columns) is stored as an ordered list of node ids from root to the last opened node:

```json
{
  "activeSessionId": "session_123",
  "activeBranchNodeIds": ["node_root", "node_3", "node_7"]
}
```

* The **last id** in `activeBranchNodeIds` is the current node for sending prompts.
* Scroll positions, which column is visually focused, and any hover/selection state are **never stored**; they live only in memory.

Only data needed to rebuild the branch and send minimal LLM payloads is persisted.

---

### 10.2 Building a minimal LLM request

For any turn (linear or branched), the LLM receives only:

* The **conversation history** along the current branch, as plain text.
* The **current prompt**.

No ids, timestamps, depths, or other metadata are sent.

1. Take `activeBranchNodeIds` for the current session.

2. For each node on this branch, in order from root to current:

   * Append its messages in chronological order as `{ role, text }`.
   * For every node after the root, insert a short **branch note** right before its first message, derived from the `parent.selection.text` of that node:

     *Example branch note text:*
     `[Branch created from previous text: "the clause describing termination"]`

3. The last user input (from the linear or context input) is sent separately as `prompt`.

Resulting request shape:

```json
{
  "history": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "text": "Explain matrix multiplication in simple terms."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "text": "Matrix multiplication combines rows and columns..."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "text": "[Branch created from previous text: \"the clause describing termination\"]"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "text": "Can you give a concrete example of that termination clause?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "text": "Sure, imagine a contract that ends when..."
    }
  ],
  "prompt": "Rewrite that example so a beginner lawyer can understand it."
}
```

All highlight/branch information that matters to the LLM is encoded in these branch note lines; no separate highlight objects, node ids, or selection offsets are sent.

---

### 10.3 LLM response and state update

The LLM responds with a single JSON object:

```json
{
  "header": "Beginner-friendly termination clause example",
  "message": "Here is a simple explanation in **markdown**..."
}
```

* `header`: short title for the current node.
* `message`: full reply in markdown, to be stored as an assistant message and rendered as such.

On successful response:

1. The user message with the current `prompt` is already present in the current node’s `messages` (it was added immediately when the user sent it).
2. It appends an assistant message with `role: "assistant"` and `text: message` to the current node’s `messages`.
3. If the node’s `header` is null, it is set to `header`.
   *If this is the root node, the session title is also set to the same string (§6).*
4. The updated session, nodes, messages and `activeBranchNodeIds` are written back to browser storage (debounced as in §9.2).

---

## 11. Data flow for common actions

### 11.1 Sending the first prompt in a session

1. User

   * Focuses the root column’s linear input.
   * Types a prompt and sends it.

2. App

   * `activeBranchNodeIds = ["node_root"]`, `currentNodeId = "node_root"`.
   * Builds the LLM request:

     * `history`: all messages along the active branch (none yet for a brand-new session).
     * `prompt`: the typed text.
   * Sends:

     ```json
     {
       "history": [],
       "prompt": "Explain matrix multiplication in simple terms."
     }
     ```

3. On LLM response

   * Receives:

     ```json
     {
       "header": "Intro to matrix multiplication",
       "message": "Matrix multiplication combines rows and columns..."
     }
     ```

   * The user message was appended to the root node’s `messages` when it was sent; on response, only the assistant message is appended:

     ```json
     { "id": "msg_2", "role": "assistant", "text": "Matrix multiplication combines rows and columns..." }
     ```

   * Sets the root node’s `header = "Intro to matrix multiplication"`.

   * Sets `session.title` to the same string.

   * Updates timestamps and persists state (sessions, nodes, `activeBranchNodeIds`, `currentNodeId`).

---

### 11.2 Continuing in the current column

1. User

   * Types into the linear input field of the current node (last id in `activeBranchNodeIds`) and sends.

2. App

   * `currentNodeId` is the node being continued.

   * Builds `history` from `activeBranchNodeIds` in order:

     * For each node on the branch:

       * Appends all its existing messages as `{ role, text }`.
       * For non-root nodes, just before their first message, appends a branch note line derived from `parent.selection.text`, for example:

         ```json
         {
           "role": "user",
           "text": "[Branch created from previous text: \"the clause describing termination\"]"
         }
         ```

   * Sets `prompt` to the new input text.

   * Sends:

     ```json
     {
       "history": [ { "role": "user", "text": "..." }, { "role": "assistant", "text": "..." }, ... ],
       "prompt": "Follow-up question here..."
     }
     ```

3. On LLM response

   * Receives:

     ```json
     {
       "header": "Refined explanation of X",
       "message": "Here is a clearer explanation in markdown..."
     }
     ```

   * The user message was appended to the current node’s `messages` when it was sent; on response, only the assistant message is appended:

     ```json
     { "id": "msg_n+1", "role": "assistant", "text": "Here is a clearer explanation in markdown..." }
     ```

   * If the node’s `header` is null, sets it to `"Refined explanation of X"`; otherwise keeps the existing header.

   * Persists updated state.

---

### 11.3 Creating a branch via context input

1. User

   * Selects text in a message in node **P**.
   * Context input appears above the selection.
   * Types a context question and sends.

2. App

   * Captures the selection:

     * `parentNodeId = P.id`.
     * `parentMessageId =` id of the message containing the selection.
     * `selection = { text, startOffset, endOffset }`.

   * Creates a new node **C**:

     ```json
     {
       "id": "node_C",
       "depth": P.depth + 1,
       "header": null,
       "parent": {
         "parentNodeId": "node_P",
         "parentMessageId": "msg_18",
         "selection": {
           "text": "the clause describing termination",
           "startOffset": 120,
           "endOffset": 180
         }
       },
       "messages": []
     }
     ```

   * Adds a highlight entry to the parent message pointing to `childNodeId = "node_C"`.

   * Updates branch state:

     * Takes the prefix of `activeBranchNodeIds` up to and including `P.id`.
     * Sets `activeBranchNodeIds = [ ..., "node_P", "node_C" ]`.
     * Sets `currentNodeId = "node_C"`.

   * Builds `history` for the **new** active branch using the same rules as in 11.2:

     * All messages from root to P.
     * A branch note for C based on `selection.text`, e.g.:

       ```json
       {
         "role": "user",
         "text": "[Branch created from previous text: \"the clause describing termination\"]"
       }
       ```

   * Sets `prompt` to the context question.

   * Sends:

     ```json
     {
       "history": [ ... ],
       "prompt": "Can you give a concrete example of that termination clause?"
     }
     ```

3. On LLM response

   * Receives:

     ```json
     {
       "header": "Concrete termination clause example",
       "message": "Here is a concrete example in **markdown**..."
     }
     ```

   * The user message was appended to node C’s `messages` when it was sent; on response, only the assistant message is appended:

     ```json
     { "id": "msg_k+1", "role": "assistant", "text": "Here is a concrete example in **markdown**..." }
     ```

   * Sets `node_C.header = "Concrete termination clause example"`.

   * Persists updated `sessions`, `activeBranchNodeIds`, `currentNodeId`.

### 11.4 Switching branches via highlight

1. User

   * Clicks a pale (inactive) highlight in node **A** that points to node **B**.

2. App

   * Reconstructs the path from the root to **B** by following `parent.parentNodeId` links, then reversing:

     ```json
     activeBranchNodeIds = ["node_root", "node_3", "node_B"]
     ```

   * Sets `currentNodeId = "node_B"`.

   * Updates `isActive` flags in `message.highlights`:

     * Highlights whose `childNodeId` is in `activeBranchNodeIds` and immediately followed on the branch become active (bright).
     * Other highlights become inactive (pale).

   * Rerenders columns to match the new `activeBranchNodeIds`.

3. No LLM request is made; branch switching reads and updates only the stored tree and branch state, then persists those changes.

---

## 12. Simplicity and extensibility

The model is intentionally minimal:

* **Single structural entity**: the node (column), with parent links, messages, and highlights.

* **Single source of truth**: one JSON state in memory, mirrored in browser storage.

* **Single LLM shape**: every call uses the same structure:

  ```json
  {
    "history": [ { "role": "user" | "assistant", "text": "..." }, ... ],
    "prompt": "..."
  }
  ```

  and always receives:

  ```json
  {
    "header": "Short node title",
    "message": "Full reply in markdown..."
  }
  ```

* **Single branching mechanism**: always from a text selection in a message, creating a child node with a parent link and a highlight in the parent message.

* **Single visible view**: only nodes along `activeBranchNodeIds` are shown as columns at any time.

Extensibility hooks:

* Nodes can be extended with additional fields (e.g. `tags`, `summary`, `pinned`).
* Messages can gain extra fields (e.g. `isDraft`, `attachments`, `editedAt`).
* Highlights can be extended to support multiple child nodes per selection or richer metadata if needed.
* Extra LLM behaviors can be layered on top of the same `{ history, prompt } → { header, message }` pattern (e.g. by encoding simple instructions into the prompt).

These additions do not change the core rules:

* One node per column.
* Highlights link selections to child nodes.
* The active branch is the only branch rendered as columns; the rest of the tree remains accessible via highlights.

## 13. Technology stack

### 13.1 Framework and language

* A React-based SPA or hybrid app using **TypeScript**.
* The UI is implemented in **React**:

  * Horizontal layout of columns for `activeBranchNodeIds`.
  * Per-column message lists and linear inputs.
  * Context input, highlights, and branching interactions.
  * Top bar and session dropdown.

All conversation state is managed on the client and hydrated from browser storage on load.

### 13.2 Styling and UI components

* **Tailwind CSS** (or a similar utility-first framework) for:

  * Minimalistic layout.
  * Helvetica (or system sans-serif) typography.
  * Thin gray separators between top bar, columns, and edge bars.
  * Root column width (e.g. `max-w-3xl`), spacing, alignment.
  * User message style (right-aligned, 80% width, light gray background).

* **Lucide icons** for:

  * Square-menu button in the top bar.
  * Arrow-down in the root placeholder.
  * Any other simple glyphs if needed.

* Small, composable components (buttons, dropdown, input fields, context input).

### 13.3 Client state and persistence

* A global store holds:

  ```json
  {
    "version": 1,
    "activeSessionId": "session_123",
    "activeBranchNodeIds": ["node_root", "node_3", "node_7"],
    "currentNodeId": "node_7",
    "sessions": {
      "session_123": {
        "id": "session_123",
        "title": "Intro to matrix multiplication",
        "rootNodeId": "node_root",
        "nodes": {
          "node_root": { ... },
          "node_3": { ... },
          "node_7": { ... }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* Implementation options:

  * React context + reducer, or
  * A lightweight state library (e.g. Zustand).

* On startup:

  * Read JSON from `localStorage` under a single key.
  * If missing or invalid, initialize with an empty default state.

* On each meaningful change (new node, new message, header update, branch switch):

  * Update the in-memory store.
  * Debounced write of the full snapshot back to `localStorage`.

Scroll positions, focus, and selections are not persisted.

### 13.4 LLM integration

* A single backend endpoint (e.g. `/api/chat`) mediates all LLM calls.

* Client sends:

  ```json
  {
    "history": [
      { "role": "user", "text": "..." },
      { "role": "assistant", "text": "..." },
      { "role": "user", "text": "[Branch created from previous text: \"...\"]" },
      { "role": "user", "text": "Follow-up question..." },
      { "role": "assistant", "text": "..." }
    ],
    "prompt": "New question here..."
  }
  ```

  where `history` is built from the current `activeBranchNodeIds` and branch notes, and `prompt` is the current input.

* Server:

  * Reads the OpenAI API key from environment variables.

  * Sends a system message describing the expected JSON output and that `history` + `prompt` form the context.

  * Sends the `{ history, prompt }` object as the content of a user message.

  * Parses the model’s JSON response:

    ```json
    {
      "header": "Short node title",
      "message": "Markdown reply..."
    }
    ```

  * Returns this object directly to the client.

The client never sees or stores the API key.

### 13.5 Data flow between UI, storage and LLM

For any turn (linear or context):

1. **UI**

   * User submits text via a linear input (current node) or context input (new branch).

2. **State**

   * If it’s a context turn, create a new node with parent link and highlight, update `activeBranchNodeIds` and `currentNodeId`.

   * Build `history` from `activeBranchNodeIds`:

     * For each node, append its messages in `{ role, text }` form.
     * For non-root nodes, insert a branch note line just before that node’s first message.

   * Set `prompt` to the current input text.

3. **Network**

   * Send `{ history, prompt }` to `/api/chat`.

4. **Response**

   * Receive `{ header, message }`.
   * Append a user message with `prompt` and an assistant message with `message` to the target node’s `messages`.
   * If the node’s header is null, set it to `header`.

     * If this is the root node, set the session title to the same string.
   * Persist the updated JSON snapshot (state + sessions) to `localStorage`.

The UI always renders from the in-memory store; browser storage is only a durable snapshot.
